/**
 * The application-wide singleton of [OkHttpClient].
 *
 * Since each [OkHttpClient] instance holds its own connection pool and thread pools, we should
 * share a single [OkHttpClient] instance across the app and reuse it for all of HTTP calls.
 * For details, please refer this document:
 * https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-ok-http-client/
 *
 * Here is an example:
 * ```
 * val okHttpClient = context.getComponent(GlobalOkHttpClient)
 * val result = okHttpClient.call(request) { response ->
 *     if (!response.isSuccessful) {
 *         throw ResponseStatusException(response.code)
 *     }
 *     checkNotNull(response.body).string()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you want to customize an [OkHttpClient] instance, use [OkHttpClient.newBuilder] like this:
 * ```
 * // Creates a new OkHttpClient that shares connection pool and thread pools with `GlobalOkHttpClient`.
 * val customizedOkHttpClient = context.getComponent(GlobalOkHttpClient).newBuilder()
 *     .readTimeout(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
 *     .build()
 * ```
